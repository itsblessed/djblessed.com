      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>Alejandro aka Blessed, was born in music. But it was Summer 2014 in Madrid when he recently got 18 years old that he assisted to a club, Zoologico Club. He really had fun there and decided to take a step further of being a music addict and he downloaded Logic Pro and started making noises. A few weeks later he earned some money as a Software Developer and bought a Numark Mixtrack Pro II and downloaded Traktor to learn how to mix. Febraury 2015 he started playing at a famous club at Madrid (Joy Eslava) and that was his first step as a club-DJ. Alex it's also working hard with his tracks that he will release soon.
      </p>
      <p>Blessed likes to describe himself as an ambitious, crazy and funny guy that loves making people have a good time. He always says the maybe his goals are so ambitious but he will work his cherry off and he won't stop until achieving them</p>
      <p>And the best its yet to come...</p>
