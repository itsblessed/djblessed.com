        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Alejandro aka Blessed, was born in music. But it was not until Summer 2014 when he recently got 18 years old and he assisted to a club, Zoologico Club. He really had fun there and decided to take a step further of being a music addict. He downloaded Logic Pro and started messing arround. A few weeks later he earned some money as a Software Developer and bought a Numark Mixtrack Pro II and downloaded Traktor to learn how to mix. Febraury 2015 he started playing at Madrid's famous club, Joy Eslava, that was his first step as a club-DJ. Alex it's also working hard in some tracks he will release soon.
        </p>
        <p>Blessed describes himself as an ambitious, crazy and funny guy that loves making people have a good time. He has always been a dreamer that works hard until he achives what he wants to.</p>
        <p>And the best its yet to come...</p>
